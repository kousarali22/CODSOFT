            <p>Mahatma Gandhi, born on October 2, 1869, in Porbandar, India, was a key figure in India’s struggle for independence from British rule. He championed the principles of truth, nonviolence, and civil disobedience, inspiring millions to resist oppression peacefully. His leadership in movements like the Salt March and Quit India Movement played a crucial role in achieving India’s freedom in 1947.

Beyond India, Gandhi’s philosophy of nonviolence influenced civil rights movements worldwide, including leaders like Martin Luther King Jr. and Nelson Mandela. Despite facing imprisonment and hardships, he remained committed to his ideals. He was assassinated on January 30, 1948, but his legacy continues to inspire movements for justice and peace.</p>
